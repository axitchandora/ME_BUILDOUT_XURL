# XURL
## Overview
XURL is a utility that can be used to generate and retrieve short URLs when we donâ€™t want to use the original longer URLs.

During the course of this project,
1.  Created a short url library with required methods.
2.  Implemented register method to take a long URL and return a shorter URL.
3.  Implemented a method to lookup the long URL by providing the short URL.
4.  Implemented hit count to track number of long URL lookups.
5.  Tested this implementation with test cases.

## Build XURL from scratch

### Scope of Work

-   Create a concrete class which implements a short URL interface class provided. It contains all the methods that can be used to create long URL to short URL mappings.
-   Implement a method to take a long URL as input, generate a random 9 character short URL and return it. Also maintain this mapping using a hash map for quick retrieval.
-   Implement a method to take a long URL and a custom short URL as input and register that mapping.
-   Error handling to make sure each long URL maps to only one short URL and vice versa.
-   Implement a method to lookup short URL for a given long URL, from the mapping created.
-   Implement a method to delete the mapping based on a long URL.
-   Implement a counter to keep track of the hit count for each long URL - which tells us how many times a particular long URL has been looked up.
-   Test these methods using test cases.
